# PyBer_Analysis

## Resources used:

For this project will will be using the following programs: - Anaconda - Python - Jupitor Program (Pandas)

[city_data.csv](https://github.com/jbailey2705/PyBer_Analysis/files/9531139/city_data.csv)
[ride_data.csv](https://github.com/jbailey2705/PyBer_Analysis/files/9531140/ride_data.csv)


## Overivew of the Analysis:

The multi-line chart provides trends of the "Total Fare by City Type" in Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas between Jan 2019 and April 2019. The highest ride shares during this time shows Urban areas was between $1,700 to $2,500 dollars, whereas the lowest was the Rural areas with totals ranging $300 and $500 dollars, the Suburbs being in the middle hovering between $800 to $1,400 dollars.

Data in the PyBer_fare_summary shows that the money made by the services was steady based on the area the drivers were servicing. 

Information in the DataFram by City Type illustates:
- # of total rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Averages of Fares per Ride
- Averages of Fares per Drivers

As you can see from the chart, Urban areas had a higher volumn of rides, along with more drivers in the area. However, the Urban drivers had a lower average Fare per ride and driver, compared to Rural and Suburban areas. With Rural drivers outperforming both Suburban and Urban drivers. 

## Conlusion

- Rural areas appear to be underserved based on the number of rides and drivers the area has. It also shows that with the lack of drivers, riders are paying a higher fare that those of Urban and Suburban areas.
- Urban riders pay less on their fares and drivers in these areas tend to make less. With the influx of drivers in the area competing services my charge a lower cost per ride that competetors.
- Over all Urban areas generate the most income from fares even at a lower cost do to the demand in the areas.
